# briefCore.Tesseract

This assembly contains almost all orginal code from https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract.
Minor things were tweaked to support .NET Core (working with assemblies and 
functions signatures from unmanaged library too, System.Drawing were replaced).

Code build on newer versions of liblept and libtesseract.
